<p>Clean up. Before you start decorating your patio, it’s important to see that everything’s clean, and free from unnecessary clutter. Dust off the doors and windows, including the walls. Take out those messy slippers and dirty rugs. You don’t want anything gets in your way of decorating.</p>

<p>Patio Decorating. As the homeowner, keep in mind that your decorating style must suit your personality and lifestyle. Coming up with a theme for your style will make it easier for you to think about what stuff to put in your porch. For example, if you’ve just been to the beach and can’t get enough of that vacation, why not use it as your theme? You might want to use native benches on your porch or place a large beach umbrella for decoration. Use your imagination and think about what makes you feel great and use it as an inspiration.</p>

<p>The welcome rug. Every porch needs a doormat or a carpet to welcome visitors coming into your house. These rugs are usually the first thing people will notice before they enter your home. Select a rug that gives a warm, welcoming feeling to people. Make sure that it’s not soiled and when it does gets dirty, change it right away into a clean one. A clean rug will immediately create an impression to your visitors.</p>

<p>Choosing your Furniture. As we’ve said, coming up with a theme will help you a lot in selecting the furniture you will use for your patio or porch. Throw pillows are great ideas to bring in color and that cozy, relaxing feeling to your porch. Also, consider the size of your patio. Don’t overcrowd it with huge chairs leaving any room for people to move on. Maybe two small chairs and a coffee table is enough to complete the look. Keeping it simple but chic, maintaining the balance is the key to achieving a great designer look.</p>

<p>Accessories. Choosing the final touches to add to your porch is an integral part of patio decorating. Plants are an excellent way to embellish your porch and give it the sense of vibrancy. You also want to add candles, vases, or wind chimes to complete the look your aiming for. Just remember, keep the theme that you started flowing. Don’t stray out from that theme so much.</p>

<p>Don’t over decorate. Make sure that the elements you combine accent and complement each other. Don’t put in too many accessories though as it might only make your patio look cluttered. Remember to keep the balance.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the suggestions above, you don’t need to have a lot of money to may your patio looks beautiful. Be creative and use your imagination. What’s more, it can be a fun activity for you and your whole family, so enjoy it and let everyone in the family participate in your patio decorating.</p>
