    <p>Does starting a garden from scratch seem like a daunting task? If you are embarking upon this project for the first time, you probably don’t know where to start. With a small design, you can have a simple, yet impressive garden in no time!</p>

<p>Brainstorm! - Decide what kind of garden will mesh with your aesthetic needs. If you want a lot of colors, you will want a specific repertoire of flowers that will appear vibrant. If you want a garden that will attract butterflies, there is a wide variety of bushes and flowers readily available to achieve this. Perhaps it is just a little curb appeal with landscaping that you are longing for. In this case, easy to maintain plants that thrive well in mulch are what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Whether it is a fairytale garden, or a vegetable garden, deciding on what you want is the first step. You need to create a mental picture. Flipping through gardening magazines is an excellent way to accomplish this. Pull any article or image that sparks your interest. By creating a folder of clippings, you will learn a lot about yourself and your gardening style! You can bring in photos of the look you desire to a local gardening center, and you will be on your way.</p>

<p>Hone in on the specifics - You will need a plan of action. The dreaming phase is over, and now you must execute your plan. You must find the perfect mix of fantasy and reality. You may want a lavish garden, but if you are living in a small apartment, your garden will live in a window box. If you want a large garden, but have little room to achieve this, you will need to learn how to be creative.</p>

<p>You will need to purchase plants that meet your goals and specific needs. You want to make sure that you do not start out with hard to grow plants if you have no time to devote to them. You also need to pick the plant choices that thrive in your region. Rare plants may look great on the box, but they will not last if they are placed in the wrong climate.</p>

<p>Decide on a time frame - Are you in need of landscaping that will be impressive at next week’s party? You will need to invest in flowers that are already in bloom, mature plants, or even call in some professionals to help get you started. Have the patience of Job? You will be able to save money on less expensive plants and give them the time they need to grow. You must also take into account the condition and quality of your soil. 
You may need to do a lot of “prep work” before you can jump into the fun part. This can be time-consuming, but it will make or break your gardening efforts. Even if you have a patch of thorns and roots, do not despair! With a little more time and a few bags of nutritious soil, your dream of a growing garden can still happen.</p>

<p>Fund your project - Creating a garden from scratch will require a lot of sweat equity, but it also needs money to make it happen. If this is not a concern, then, by all means, jump in and start digging! For the rest of us, we may have to be a bit resourceful. If funds are limited, you may have to start very small and add to your garden over time.</p>

<p>This is a successful road to gardening without breaking the bank. You also have the choice of swapping a want, not for lack. Explanation - you probably have things laying around the house that you could sell and make enough profit to fund your garden without breaking into your bank account. You ever have the option of buying cheap plants and flowers on clearance.</p>

<p>Make things easy on yourself! - Consider starting out with a simple garden that is easy to maintain. You up your chances of getting your desired result if you do not bite off more than you can chew. A finished, flourishing small garden looks better than a sizeable struggling garden that has not been thought through. You also need to start with the right tools.</p>

<p>A few right tools will save you time and money in the long run. You can find out what your garden will require by visiting a helpful nursery or garden center with a knowledgeable staff. They will usually be very willing to offer plant and tool selections to you. You must be very patient and willing to stay the course. With anything else, practice does make perfect. You will lose plants, you will get frustrated, and you will succeed - If you have the drive to see it though. Good luck!</p>
