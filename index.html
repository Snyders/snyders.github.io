              If you ask me, winter is a great time to get reacquainted with some of the often ignored, in-season fruits. Of sure, you can always focus your time and affections on the popular fruits like grapefruits, oranges and kiwis. We all know that an orange contains a lot of vitamin C.

              Probably the most famous fruit tree for the backyard orchard, apple trees come in some varieties that are well suited to just about any space. A single tree can yield enough fruit for the whole family to enjoy, and provide a shady corner for relaxation, while a row of trees can make an attractive and fruitful privacy screen.

              When moved into my first house, I wanted to create a genuinely picture perfect home for my family. We had our very first backyard, after living in a condo, mobile home, an apartment. We had three children at the time, and I decided that the right side of our house was the perfect place for our garden, it was an overly broadside yard and had lots of room for a large garden. I wanted to impress my husband and began work on my private project. None that were real at least. I had no gardening experience whatsoever, but how hard could it be, I thought.
